      <h3>üîê Blockchain-Based Voting Poll</h3>
      <p>
        In an era demanding trust and transparency, this project reimagines how we conduct digital voting. I built a fully decentralized voting platform on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts. The system ensures that each eligible voter can vote only once, while every vote is recorded immutably on the blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        From engineering smart contract logic to integrating a secure front-end for casting votes, this project showcases not just my technical fluency but also my belief in using tech for social good. Imagine governments or student bodies executing trustworthy elections from their phones‚Äîthat‚Äôs the dream this project steps toward.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Stellar SDK, Soroban Contracts, JavaScript, Web3</p>

      <h3>üß† AI Image Generator</h3>
      <p>
        What if creativity could be summoned by typing a few words? This deep learning-based project does exactly that‚Äîan AI-powered generator that crafts images from text prompts. I trained neural networks to transform abstract user input like ‚Äúsunset on Mars‚Äù into high-quality, realistic visuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I handled everything from dataset curation and preprocessing to model training, hyperparameter tuning, and output enhancement. The result? A tool that fuses tech and art, allowing anyone to generate dreamscapes and digital content with ease.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, CNNs, Data Augmentation, GANs</p>

      <h3>üìà Zerodha Clone ‚Äì Stock Trading Platform</h3>
      <p>
        Inspired by one of India‚Äôs most popular trading platforms, I built a replica of Zerodha that emulates its core functionalities including portfolio visualization, dummy order placements, and real-time chart simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond interface design, this project challenged me to ensure smooth data handling, route management, and responsive interactivity using modern frontend practices. It serves as both a demonstration of my UI/UX capability and my growing backend architecture skills.
